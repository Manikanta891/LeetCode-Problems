# üöÄ Problem Summary:
# Given: A partially filled 9x9 Sudoku board with empty cells represented as '.'
# Goal: Modify the board in-place to fill in digits (1 to 9) such that the board becomes a valid Sudoku solution

# üß© Brute Force Idea:
# Try all numbers (1 to 9) in every empty cell recursively
# For each placement, check if it's valid; if so, move to next cell
# Backtrack if we reach an invalid state
# Time: Extremely high ‚Äî O(9^(n)) for n empty cells
# Space: O(n) ‚Äî recursion stack

# ‚ö° Optimization / Pattern Used:
# Pattern: Backtracking + Constraint Checking
# At every empty cell:
#   - Try placing digits from 1 to 9
#   - Validate choice (check row, column, and 3x3 box)
#   - If valid, place it and continue recursively
#   - If stuck, undo (backtrack) and try the next digit
# Why needed? ‚Üí Efficient pruning of invalid paths early

# üîë Key Insight:
# Sudoku has strict constraints:
#   - No repetition in rows, columns, or 3x3 subgrids
# By validating choices **before placing**, we drastically reduce invalid search paths

# üß† Why it works:
# - Each recursive call solves the board one cell at a time
# - If all cells are filled successfully, the board is solved
# - Backtracking ensures we undo bad decisions and explore other options

# üìà Time & Space Complexity:
# Time: Worst case is O(9^81) ‚Äî though pruned heavily with validation
# Space: O(1) for board + O(depth) for recursion stack (~81 max)

# üìù My Takeaway:
# This is a classic example of constraint-based recursion
# Validity checks (row, col, box) are key to cutting down the search space
# Clean board logic + smart backtracking = powerful problem-solving combo
